# NinjaskVG
A framework built to organize, maintain, and perform various operations on a video game collection. Planned features include estimating the value of an item or overall collection, labeling games with recognizable keywords, and suggesting similar games to add later.

Currently, I am tracking my collection on the site vgcollect.com under this same username (epicninjask123). My reasoning for creating this site is to add my own features that I would like to see on that site, notably an easy way to estimate the total value of my collection.

Currently, major tasks are:
-Convert VGCollect data to format usable by this site
-Plan how this will be launched. Is it a web app? Desktop app? Something else?
-Implement pricing feature.
-Add value to store length of the game.
